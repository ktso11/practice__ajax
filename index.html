           <!-- 3. HTML5 SEMANTICS and ARIA -->
      <!--  it's easier for both people and machines to read and understand it
        ( accessible rich internet applications)

      ARIA roles for accessibility - mainly for screen readers. Some other
      roles includes: article, img, row, toolbar, textbox, search
      https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-1.1/roles for a full list
    
     ARIA is a set of attributes that developers add to web content 
     to make applications more accessible to users with disabilities
     communicate with a subset of the DOM called the accessibility tree.
     The accessibility tree is a more simplified rendering of a website, 
     this is what screen readers read from -->
    <nav role="navigation">
      <ul role="menu">
        <!-- ARIA ATTR - Aria Owns 
        aria-owns. To let the DOM now that the menu item has a 
        parent child relationship with the menu items nested under it-->
        <li aria-owns="child-item">
          <a href="" role="menu-item"></a>
        </li>
      </ul>

    </nav>
    <!-- 4. IMG ATTR
